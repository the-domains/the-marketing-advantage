Hearing What Your </b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Patients Are
Saying?</b></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>by Juan
Nodarse</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>president, The
Marketing Advantage</i></p><p>Your patients are talking to you, but are you listening?
They’re attempting to communicate. They’re trying to give you insights into how
you can enhance your marketing and grow your practice.Are you taking advantage of what they are
trying to tell you? Or are you missing a powerful opportunity?</p><p>Traditionally, understanding patients and their motives has
been done through marketing research. But marketing research can be expensive.
For example, a basic patient satisfaction survey sent via postal mail could
cost you as much as $25-$30,000.</p><p><b>Strategic Listening</b></p><p>So what do you do? One solution to better understanding your
target audience, without the expense and hassle of marketing research, is to
create a strategic listening program that provides great benefit, without the
cost of traditional marketing research. </p><p>A strategic listening program can be fairly simple,
inexpensive, and powerful. You may be surprised by how much of this you are
already doing. By considering the following four areas of ‘listening’, you can
easily create your own strategic listening program.</p><ol><li>Personal
     observation</li><li>Current
     metrics</li><li>Traditional
     marketing research</li><li>Technology
     analytics</li></ol><p><b>Personal Observation</b></p><p>You, your staff, your family, and your neighbors have
hundreds, if not thousands, of one-on-one contacts with patients and
prospective patients on a regular basis. Each and every contact you have with
your target audience is an opportunity to capture valuable marketing
information. But are you capturing it?</p><p>Think about it. Each employee was listening to and recording
hundreds to thousands of customer feedback interactions. Liistening to your
target audience and making decisions based on their feedback!It really is that simple.</p><p>That’s the power of ongoing listening. By systematizing the
items that you or your team see, hear, or read, you’ll be amazed at what you
learn about your patients and their perspectives of your services.</p><p>Improving personal observations does not have to be
complicated for you or your staff. Keep an index card in every adjusting room
or even in your pocket. Have your staff keep one with them at all times. The
magic begins when people start recording information as they see it. It may be:</p><p>o</p><p>













































Questions
that your patients ask, </p><p>o</p><p>

Comments
patients make, both verbal and non-verbal, or</p><p>o</p><p>

Things you
see, read, or hear from media outlets</p><p>If you get in the habit of gathering all the information
your employees have been collecting and discussing the things that your team is
‘observing’, you’ll start developing a culture of listening. Go a step further
and reward, even if just with positive reinforcement, those employees that
capture the most insightful information and you could be on your way to
unleashing the power of strategic listening.</p><p>The bottom line is that personal observation is not hard,
doesn’t cost a dime, and can provide valuable information to enhance your
clinic marketing efforts. Just think of all the things your patients are trying
to tell you that you’re missing out on!</p><p><b>Practice Metrics</b></p><p>Practice metrics are the quantifiable data that you capture
in your regular business processes. Everybody has them. Successful
chiropractors gain incredible advantages by finding, utilizing, and eventually
interpreting their metrics for marketing advantage.</p><p>The most obvious metrics are the traditional practice
management numbers you’ve all been taught: patient visit average, new patients,
case visit average, etc. But depending on your practice, there are a lot of
other metrics that could be beneficial to your marketing efforts. There are
hundreds of metrics you could use. For example:</p><p>o</p><p>



















Your zip
code ratios may have significant impact on your marketing choices,</p><p>o</p><p>

Your
patient demographics, such as age, may also provide valuable insight about how
to deliver marketing messages, and</p><p>o</p><p>

Your
patient employment and education levels can influence the words you use and the
message you send.</p><p>Even more powerful are practice metrics that you add to your
information gathering process to specifically improve or enhance your
communications, advertising, and marketing. Some of these metrics may be
additional demographic information that you decide to capture, but it could
also be psychographic information.</p><p>Psychographic information is the information that provides
insight into the personality, values, attitudes, interests, or lifestyles of
your customers and prospects. These metrics are rarely included in the
information chiropractors gather from patients. But, if you can figure out how
and when to capture psychographic information, you’ll find that it may be even
more valuable than traditional demographic information in regards to your
marketing efforts.</p><p>For example, one chiropractor includes information about
individual and family activities in his new patient protocol. This information,
such as activities the family participates in, radio and TV station viewership,
and newspaper readership can provide not only information that may help guide
the marketing efforts, but also allow the practice to speak the language of
their audience—this equates to powerful marketing communications.</p><p><b>Traditional Marketing
Research</b></p><p>To understand how to incorporate traditional marketing
research into your strategic listening plan, we first need to review a few
basics of marketing research. There are two types of marketing research:
primary and secondary.</p><p>Primary research is that which you conduct yourself, while
secondary research is that which somebody else conducts.A key component of a strategic listening
program can be secondary <a href="http://research.You" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research.You</a>
may not realize it, but there are many information-gathering efforts going on
in your community, in your state, or even within your profession that you may
be able to access.</p><p>While secondary research obviously does not address you
specifically, there is a lot of valuable information you can gain. In most
situations, this information is free or very affordable.A few ways you can find secondary research
data:</p><p>o</p><p>



























Ask your
Chamber of Commerce for any consumer data that may be available for your market
area.</p><p>o</p><p>

Ask local
TV stations about possible TOMA, or Top of Mind Awareness, studies they may
have conducted.</p><p>o</p><p>

Check with
websites such as <a href="http://www.freedemographics.com/">www.freedemographics.com</a>
for data based on the U.S. Census.</p><p>Primary research is marketing research efforts that you
undertake to gather information for your private use. There are two types of
primary research, quantitative and qualitative. </p><p>Surveys are great for quantifying and benchmarking
information. For example, a patient satisfaction survey done once a year can
provide a great metric for your performance that you can compare annually for
trends. With the availability of electronic e-mail surveys from sites such as
Constant Contact and Zoomerang, these surveys are now easy to do and in many
cases free. </p><p>You can simplify and expedite quantitative methods is by
creating a question of the week or question of the month. Depending on the
frequency of contact with your patients, you can receive a lot of information
in a short amount of time by doing so.</p><p>You can also electronically capture data by incorporating
your ‘Question of the Week or Month’ into your customer e-newsletter or
offering a poll on the front of your website.All of these are ways to listen to your audience that are sometimes much
less expensive, less intrusive, and easier to implement than a complete survey,
but may tell you much more.</p><p>In contrast to quantitative methods, qualitative efforts are
those where you gain further insight about the feelings and attitudes of your
target audience through open-ended or subjective methods.Examples of qualitative research are focus
groups and in-depth interviews.</p><p>In-depth interviews are a wonderful process to gain insight
of a broad, unquantifiable nature. You can conduct these interviews yourself,
or you can hire a trained marketing person. Either way, the thing I love about
in-depth interviews is that conducting 12-20 interviews can provide a clear direction
or even general consensus from the targeted group you’ve interviewed. </p><p>I also find that in-depth interviews are a wonderful way of
deepening a relationship with select audiences.For example, if you conduct in-depth interviews with your leading referral
sources, not only will you gain relevant useful information to help you improve
your referral efforts, but you may also find that their willingness and
commitment to referring patients to you is enhanced.</p><p>Focus groups are similar in that they can be a key component
of your strategic listening efforts, don’t have to be expensive and you can
conduct these sessions yourself, and can provide valuable insight to your
information gathering. </p><p>If you consider that a focus groups is nothing more than a
group discussion with patients or prospective patients, and that any
information you hear is simply a piece of the total story—and don’t jump to
conclusions, then conducting focus groups can be extremely valuable.</p><p><b>Internet Technology</b></p><p>Remember that Internet technology can also be a great
‘listening’ device. Website analytics, feedback on social media sites, and
electronic patient feedback forms can all benefit your strategic listening
efforts at a very low cost and low time and energy cost to you.If you can capture any metrics automatically
using technology, do so!It will
increase the validity of your data and make your life easier.</p><p>Make sure that these electronic metrics are part of your
strategic listening efforts. Consider the topics you include in your
e-newsletters as mini-marketing research efforts. Include four or five short
articles in your e-newsletter and then track the click-throughs on your e-mail
tracking system to see where your customers’ or prospective customers’
interests lie. Or place three articles on the front page of your website, and
track which are most appealing to your website visitors. </p><p>Again, these are all elements that when considered as
individual parts of your practice may not mean much, but when put together as
part of a strategic, comprehensive listening approach can provide insight into
your patients’ needs, problems, and <a href="http://opinions.In" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opinions.In</a> the end, that knowledge is valuable marketing information that you
can use to enhance and grow your practice to the benefit of your current and
future patients. </p><p>Best of all, you can incorporate many of these concepts at
no, or little, cost and as a regular part of your marketing management efforts.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f7c3ec56-801c-4abc-9991-00034d707975.jpg"></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
